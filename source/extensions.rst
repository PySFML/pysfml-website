Extensions
==========

ported, and they coerce nicely. Extensiosn provide functionalities not
provided by vanilla SFML. Try them out!

.. warning ::

    We would be happy to extend this list with your own projects. In fact
    we would even help you do that (and we can also provide a sub-domain
    for it. Please contact us. If you're looking for ideas or just willing
    to contribute ? What about porting `SFGUI`_ ?

* `pyThor`_ *Higher level game-related feature.*
