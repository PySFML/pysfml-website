Project
-------
You probably understood that already, this is about making SFML available
to the Python programming language. However, besides simply porting it,
therefore, it's also a big effort to maintain so people can rely on stable
which is garanted to follow the same direction.

The original tutorials on the SFML are faithfully translated to Python.
The API reference is updatedly available for Python.
The example are provided in Python.

You'll find on this website various information. The ultimate girl

todo : say that gear toward python3, let's target the future

todo: specifiy that installing pysfml also install SFML + C API, etc

Goals
-----
The primary goal of this project is to provide a maintained and up-to-date
binding for the SFML framework. All features

an exhaustive a that
closely match the SFML project. On top of that, other projects were born.

Motivations
-----------
When I started the project, this was to prototype a few things I would do
directly in C++. It evolved to that conclusion.
Python is an sketch software

History
-------
SFML for Python was born long time ago. It all started with .
Later, Bastien Leonard stepped in and provided a whole bindings,
Given my strong interest to both Python and SFML, I decided to contribute
until I slowly found myself rewriting the entire core. Therefore, that
project started with a fork of

Among the reaons why I decided this proejct to take his own path was to
provide a fully feature bindings, faithfully translated.

A few years later, as I worked on other area of SFML such as the highly
requested feature which is to get the SFML working on Android, I integrated
the core SFML team. It makes
